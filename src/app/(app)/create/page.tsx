/**
 * Create: record in the app or upload an existing file (spec §17, §18).
 * `/create` is a protected route: `src/proxy.ts` already redirects a
 * signed-out/not-onboarded visitor at the edge, but that's a UX convenience,
 * never the authorization boundary (see docs/SECURITY.md) — every protected
 * Server Component independently calls `requireOnboarded`, and this one did
 * not until now. See the header comment in `CreateFlow.tsx` for the client
 * capture flow and `actions.ts` for the Server Actions it now calls.
 *
 * `?track=<id>` (from Explore's "Tracks to sing over" lane or `/tracks`,
 * spec §4) is resolved here, server-side, rather than fetched again on the
 * client: `getBackingTrackById` already reads through the caller's RLS-scoped
 * client, so an id for a track that is neither curated, open-for-vocals nor
 * the caller's own simply resolves to `null` — a quiet fallback to "no
 * track", never an error screen over one stale or mistyped link.
 *
 * `?challenge=<slug>` (from a challenge's "Enter with a new Wave", spec §4
 * `docs/CHALLENGES.md`) is resolved the same way, through `getChallengeBySlug`
 * — which already reads through RLS, so a slug that is hidden or missing
 * quietly resolves to no challenge rather than an error screen. Its own
 * backing track, if it has one, preselects the same way `?track=` does,
 * unless the link already named an explicit `track`.
 *
 * Both params are Zod-validated (`uuidSchema`/`challengeSlugSchema`) before
 * ever reaching a database call — not for injection safety (every read
 * below is already parameterized) but because CLAUDE.md requires every
 * input validated, and an unbounded `p_slug` otherwise reaches Postgres
 * straight from a public param on a protected route (review2 #9). A
 * malformed value is treated exactly like a valid-but-unresolvable one:
 * ignored, never an error screen.
