/**
 * The icon set (`docs/design/DESIGN.md` §9).
 *
 * Phosphor Icons, `regular` weight, 1.5px stroke on a 16px grid, at 16 / 20 /
 * 24px. This is a deliberate swap away from `lucide-react`: Lucide is the
 * shadcn default and reads as such, and its uniform 2px stroke fights the
 * hairline system (§12.26).
 *
 * One rule carries all icon state: **outline means available, fill means
 * engaged.** Saved is a filled bookmark, the active tab is a filled glyph,
 * playing is a filled pause. Pass `weight="fill"` for engaged; never a colour.
 *
 * Every icon in the product comes from this module, so the set can never
 * drift, mix weights, or acquire a hand-rolled glyph. Names are kept stable
 * across the swap so call sites keep reading in plain English; the comment on
 * each line records the Phosphor glyph actually being drawn where it differs.
 *
 * Imported from `@phosphor-icons/react/dist/ssr/<Icon>` one file at a time:
 * the `ssr` build carries no `"use client"` boundary, so a Server Component
 * can render an icon without becoming a Client Component, and the per-icon
 * path keeps the 1,500-glyph barrel out of the graph entirely.
 *
 * AKINTI's own marks are drawn geometry, not icons: the waterline, the
 * write-head, the record dot and the Duet mark are never in this file.
